Part 3: Functional Dependency Theory (35 points)
Consider the following two relational schemas and sets of functional dependencies:
a. (10 points) R(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies D → B, CE → A.

Answer: R1(B, D), R3(A, C, E), R4(C, D, E)
R(A,B,C,D,E)
D → B, CE → A.
X = D
X⁺ = {D, B}, not R nor X⁺ = X
R1(D, B) AND R2(A, C, D, E)

Normalize(R1)
R1(D, B)
X = D
X⁺ = {D, B}, which is R1
There is no X that dissatisfies the condition where X⁺ is C or X⁺ is X
R1 is in BCNF.

Normalize(R2)
R2(A, C, D, E)
X = {C, E}
X⁺ = {C, E, A}, which is not R2 nor X
R3(A, C, E) AND R4(C, D, E)

Normalize(R3)
R3(A, C, E)
X = {C, E}
X⁺ = {C, E, A}, which is R3
There is no X that dissatisfies the condition where X⁺ is R3 or X⁺ is X
R3 is in BCNF.

Normalize(R4)
R4(C, D, E)
There is no X that dissatisfies the condition where X⁺ is R4 or X⁺ is X
R4 is in BCNF.

Therefore,
R1(B, D), R3(A, C, E), R4(C, D, E) are in BCNF.

b. (10 points) S(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies A → E, BC → A, DE → B.
For each of the above schemas, decompose it into BCNF. Show all of your work and explain, at each step, 
which dependency violations you are correcting. Make sure you describe each step in your decomposition steps. (5 points each)

Answer: S1(A, E), S3(A, B, C), S4(B, C, D)
S(A,B,C,D,E)
A → E, BC → A, DE → B
X = A
X⁺ = {A, E}, which is not X nor S
S1(A, E) AND S2(A, B, C, D)

Normalize(S1)
S1(A, E)
X = A
X⁺ = {A, E}
There is no X that dissatisfies the condition where X⁺ is S1 or X⁺ is X
So S1(A, E) is in BCNF.

Normalize(S2)
S2(A, B, C, D)
X = {B, C}
X⁺ = {A, B, C}, which is not S2 nor X
S3(A, B, C) AND S4(B, C, D)

Normalize(S3)
S3(A, B, C)
X = {B, C}
X⁺ = {A, B, C}
There is no X that dissatisfies the condition where X⁺ is S3 or X⁺ is X
So S3(A, B, C) is in BCNF.

Normalize(S4)
S4(B, C, D)
There is no X that dissatisfies the condition where X⁺ is S3 or X⁺ is X
So S4(B, C, D) is in BCNF.

Therefore,
S1(A, E), S3(A, B, C), S4(B, C, D) are in BCNF.

For each of the above schemas, decompose it into BCNF. Show all of your work and explain, at each step, 
which dependency violations you are correcting. Make sure you describe each step in your decomposition steps. (5 points each)
A set of attributes X is called closed (with respect to a given set of functional dependencies) if 
X⁺ = X. Consider a relation with schema R(A,B,C,D) and an unknown set of functional dependencies. 
For each closed attribute set below, give a set of functional dependencies that is consistent with it.
c. (5 points) All subsets of {A,B,C,D} are closed.

Answer: Satisfies if there is no functional dependency.
If there is at least one functional dependency like A → B, 
X = A
X⁺ = {A, B}, which is not closed. So there cannot be any functional dependency.

d. (5 points) The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {} and {A,B,C,D}.

Answer: A → B, B → C, C → D, D → A
A → B, B → C, C → D, D → A
Then, 
X = A, X = B, X = C, X = D
would all result in being not closed as X⁺ would not be X. 
Therefore, these functional dependencies will satisfy the condition.

e. (5 points) The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {}, {B,C}, and {A,B,C,D}.

Answer: A → BD, B → C, C → B, D → A
There are 16 possibilities in total.
A → BD, B → C, C → B, D → A
X = A
X⁺ = {A, B, C, D} not closed
X = B
X⁺ = {B, C} not closed
X = C
X⁺ = {C, B} not closed
X = D
X⁺ = {D, A, B, C} not closed
X = {A, B, C, D}
X⁺ = {A, B, C} not closed
X = {A, C}
X⁺ = {A, B, C, D} not closed
X = {B, C}
X⁺ = {B, C} closed
X = {B, D}
X⁺ = {B, C, D, A} not closed
X = {C, D}
X⁺ = {A, B, C, D} not closed
X = {D, A}
X⁺ = {A, B, C, D} not closed
X = {A, B, C}
X⁺ = {A, B, C, D} not closed
X = {A, B, D}
X⁺ = {A, B, C, D} not closed
X = {A, C, D}
X⁺ = {A, B, C, D} not closed
X = {B, C, D}
X = {A, B, C, D} not closed
X = {A, B, C, D}
X⁺ = {A, B, C, D} closed
X = {}
X⁺ = {} closed
