Course Goals
Databases are at the heart of modern commercial application development. Their use extends beyond this to many other environments and domains where large amounts of data must be stored for efficient update, retrieval, and analysis. The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the use of management systems for applications. Some of the topics covered are the following: data models (relational and json), query languages (SQL, datalog, etc), transactions, parallel data processing, and database as a service. For the detailed list of topics and schedule, please see the course site.
